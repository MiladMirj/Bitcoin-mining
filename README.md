# Bitcoin-mining
Complete bitcoin mining using Python
This Python source code is a complete implementation of Bitcoin mining, as demonstrated in my YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoX1OZt2K18.
## Description
The code generates a block header with all the required information, including the Bitcoin client version and the hash of the previous block. It then proceeds to mine the block. For more information about the mining process, please refer to the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_z-QbjWzQM.
## Requirements
```
$ pip install pandas
```
To use this code, you will need to download the blockdata.txt file from the following website: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5246271.0. This file contains the necessary data for mining the block.
